    "The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic tool that gives graphical measurements and recordings on the electrical activity of the heart over time. It is commonly used for diagnosing diseases by deducing the signal. Cardiovascular diseases and abnormalities alter the ECG wave shape; each portion of the ECG waveform carries information that is relevant to the clinician in arriving at a proper diagnosis which makes the correct interpretation and processing of the signal important. [1]. An ECG is generated by a nerve impulse stimulus to the heart. [1]\n",
    "This paper briefly discusses the basic steps and techniques used in performing an ECG with a description of the stages on signal processing applied to the electrocardiogram."
